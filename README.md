Net Probe: Network Traffic Analysis Tool
Developed Net Probe, a Flask-based web application designed to analyze and visualize network traffic from PCAP files. The tool provides detailed insights into network activity, including credentials, DNS queries, HTTP communications, SSL/TLS sessions, open ports, and network maps. Key features include:
User Authentication: Secure login and registration system with password hashing for user management.
PCAP File Analysis: Extracts and categorizes network data such as credentials, DNS queries, HTTP traffic, FTP sessions, and more using Scapy.
Interactive Data Visualization: Renders analyzed data into user-friendly HTML templates for easy interpretation.
Network Mapping: Generates a visual representation of network connections and interactions.
Security Insights: Identifies open ports, SSL/TLS sessions, and potential vulnerabilities in network traffic.
Technologies Used: Python, Flask, Scapy, MySQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript.
Net Probe showcases my ability to build secure, data-driven web applications and analyze network traffic for security insights. It highlights my expertise in backend development, data parsing, and visualization, as well as my passion for network security and analysis.
